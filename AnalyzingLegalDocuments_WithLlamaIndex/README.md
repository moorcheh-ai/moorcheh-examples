# AI LegalSight: Semantic Legal Search with Moorcheh

This example demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to search and answer questions over legal documents â€” specifically the **Canadian Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)** â€” using **Moorcheh** as the vector database and **LlamaIndex** for document ingestion and querying.

The goal is to showcase how Moorcheh can power legal information retrieval using semantic understanding, all with a single API call.

## Key Features

- Uses **Moorcheh's API** for embedding, storage, and retrieval  
- Fully integrated with **LlamaIndex**  
- Focused on legal documents for question answering  
- Clean ingestion pipeline and reproducible queries  
- Demonstrates RAG using only **one API key** (Moorcheh)
